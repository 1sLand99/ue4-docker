Under Windows and macOS, Engine licensees can easily download and manage Installed Builds of Unreal Engine through the Epic Games Launcher.
Since version 4.21.0 of the Engine, ue4-docker provides an alternative source of Installed Builds under Linux in lieu of a native version of the launcher.

NOTE: This page has migrated to the https://unrealcontainers.com/[Unreal Containers community hub].
You can find the new version here: https://unrealcontainers.com/docs/use-cases/linux-installed-builds[Use Cases: Linux Installed Builds].
